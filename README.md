# Unemployment_Analysis_with_Python
This is an analysis project on unemployment,which has increased greatly after the covid situation.
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people
who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. 
In this project, I have used different python functions from different modules to do the analysis of the unemployment situation.
